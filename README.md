### Legacy Expense Tracking

The application maintains expense tracking capabilities from its Spliit foundation for groups that need both gift planning and expense management.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the web application
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling
- [shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) to access the database
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting (application and database)

## Contribute

The project is a fork of [Spliit](https://github.com/spliit-app/spliit), adapted for collaborative gift planning and voting. Contributions are welcome!

## Run locally

1. Clone the repository (or fork it if you intend to contribute)
2. Start a PostgreSQL server. You can run `./scripts/start-local-db.sh` if you don’t have a server already.
3. Copy the file `.env.example` as `.env`
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This will also apply database migrations and update Prisma Client.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Run in a container

1. Run `npm run build-image` to build the docker image from the Dockerfile
2. Copy the file `container.env.example` as `container.env`
3. Run `npm run start-container` to start the postgres and the spliit2 containers
4. You can access the app by browsing to http://localhost:3000

## Health check

The application has a health check endpoint that can be used to check if the application is running and if the database is accessible.

- `GET /api/health/readiness` or `GET /api/health` - Check if the application is ready to serve requests, including database connectivity.
- `GET /api/health/liveness` - Check if the application is running, but not necessarily ready to serve requests.

## Opt-in features

### Expense documents

Spliit offers users to upload images (to an AWS S3 bucket) and attach them to expenses. To enable this feature:

- Follow the instructions in the _S3 bucket_ and _IAM user_ sections of [next-s3-upload](https://next-s3-upload.codingvalue.com/setup#s3-bucket) to create and set up an S3 bucket where images will be stored.
- Update your environments variables with appropriate values:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPENSE_DOCUMENTS=true
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1
```

You can also use other S3 providers by providing a custom endpoint:

```.env
S3_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
```

### Create expense from receipt

You can offer users to create expense by uploading a receipt. This feature relies on [OpenAI GPT-4 with Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) and a public S3 storage endpoint.

To enable the feature:

- You must enable expense documents feature as well (see section above). That might change in the future, but for now we need to store images to make receipt scanning work.
- Subscribe to OpenAI API and get access to GPT 4 with Vision (you might need to buy credits in advance).
- Update your environment variables with appropriate values:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECEIPT_EXTRACT=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Deduce category from title

You can offer users to automatically deduce the expense category from the title. Since this feature relies on a OpenAI subscription, follow the signup instructions above and configure the following environment variables:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CATEGORY_EXTRACT=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
